Automated Line Mapping Tool for Versioned Files

# Introduction
This project focuses on building a simple tool that compares two versions of a text file and shows how lines from the old file map to lines in the new one. The goal was to make it easier to track changes and understand how content moves or gets updated between versions. To do this, we used Java to read, normalize, and compare files, and then generated a clear mapping of where each original line ended up. The results show that the tool can efficiently identify matching lines, highlight changes, and give a straightforward view of edits, which can be useful for debugging, version tracking, or understanding code updates
